A repository of code snippets for MaxCompiler (Maxeler DFEs).
==============================================================

It turns out that plenty of everyday problems for MaxCompiler require
coding similar problems again and again. This repository collects
examples of such elementary problems as self-contained MaxCompiler
projects to allow re-use where necessary.
