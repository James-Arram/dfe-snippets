Wish list for projects to be added (feel free to update!):

Infrastructure:
 - examples of porting projects from older MaxCompiler to newer versions
 - examples of makefiles for simplified build or linking DFE code to third party codes
 - examples of project files targeting various DFEs

Summation:
 - partial summator with fixed loop length = 16 (16 > 13 = summation latency)
 - partial summator with fixed loop length = 13 ?
 - partial summator with variable loop length
 - full summator with fixed loop length = 16 and total summation of whole summation loop
 - full summator with fixed loop length = 16 and summation tree (branching out of summation loop)
 - full summator with variable loop length: how ?
 - alterations for fixed and floating point?

Linear algebra, BLAS L2-L3 (data in DRAM)
 - dense n x m matrix-vector multiply: very small ranks (whole matrix multiply fits to chip)
 - dense n x m matrix-vector multiply: medium ranks (scalar products fit to chip, streaming matrix rows)
 - dense n x m matrix-vector multiply: large ranks (streaming both scalar products and matrix rows)
 - dense symmetric matrix-vector multiply
 - same for matrix-matrix multiply. Tricks for data re-use on-chip.
 - sparse (CSR) n x m matrix-vector multiply with fixed density per row
 - sparse (CSR) n x m matrix-vector multiply with variable density per row - dynamic offsets
 - sparse (CSR) n x m matrix-vector multiply with variable density per row - manual dealing with BRAM buffers for optimal resource re-use
 - symmetrix CSR matrix-vector multiply with variable density per row and manual BRAM buffers
 - block-CSR matrix multiply - variable density per row
 - banded dense matrix
 - tri-diagonal direct solve
 - upper-triangular solve
 - lower-triangular solve
 - Cholesky for small matrix
 - determinant of dense matrix: incremental updates (when matrix inverse is known). Sherman-Morrison.

Splines, fitting, bernstein polynomials?
RNG, distributions
