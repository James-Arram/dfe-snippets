 This project implements partial summation on DFE with fixed length of
 feedback summation loop. The length of this loop is hardcoded so that it
 exceeds the summator latency (important for floating point arithmetic
 adder which has latency 13, for FPGAs used in MAX4). This is
 probably the simpliest way of implementing summation (or whatever
 computation with accumulated state) with minimal hardware costs.

 This project is auto-generated with MaxIDE with manual updates in few
 places:
  - CPU code
  - Engine code: partial summation kernel, manager
  - project files are for Maia MAX4, but are not properly set up
    for hardware build
  - some leftovers from initial project name in project files are
    unavoidable

 Tested in simulation mode, has NOT been tested on hardware.
